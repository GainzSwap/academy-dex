### **Slide 2: Project Introduction**

**Problem Statement:**

- Most decentralized exchanges (DEXs) suffer from two major challenges:
  - **Low liquidity**: Leads to high slippage and poor user experience.
  - **Impermanent loss**: Liquidity providers often experience losses, which discourages them from contributing.

**Academy-DEX's Solution:**

- Academy-DEX tackles these challenges with **dynamic fees**, **deep liquidity management**, and **governance-driven ecosystem** that ensures sustainable rewards for liquidity providers and users.
